#Working on Tuples 

#What is Tuple? 
#Tuple is a collection of items which is ordered and unchangeable/immutable... It can not be changed, modified or deleted.

#Creating a Tuple
coordinates = (4, 5)

print(coordinates)

print(coordinates[1]) #This prints out the second element in the tuple by indexing it.

#coordinates[1] = 10 #This will give an error because tuples are immutable and can not be changed.

#Tuples can be used to store multiple values
coordinates = [(4, 5), (6, 7), (80, 34)]

print(coordinates)

#Difference between Tuples and Lists

#Tuples are immutable, they can not be changed, modified or deleted. While Lists are mutable, they can be changed, modified or deleted.

#Tuples are used to store multiple values, while Lists are used to store multiple values.

#Tuples are faster than Lists, because they are immutable, while Lists are slower than Tuples, because they are mutable.

#Tuples are used to store values that wouldnt be changed, while Lists are used to store values that would be changed.
