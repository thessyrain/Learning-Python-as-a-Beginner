#WhileLoops in Python


#What is a while loop?
#A while loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given Boolean condition. The while loop can be thought of as a repeating if statement.


#Creating a while loop
i = 1
while i <= 10:
    print(i)
    i += 1

print ("Done with loop")

#This prints out the numbers from 1 to 10
